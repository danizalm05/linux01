Nmap (Network Mapper) is a free and open-source network detection and security scanning utility. Many network and system administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring server or service availability. Nmap uses raw IP packets in a novel way to determine the hosts available on the network, the services they offer (application name and version), and the operating systems they are running (and operating systems). version). It's designed to scan large networks quickly but works well with a single host.
