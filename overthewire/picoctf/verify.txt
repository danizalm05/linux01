People keep trying to trick my players with imitation flags.
I want to make sure they get the real thing! Iâ€™m going to 
provide the SHA-256 hash and  a decrypt script to help you know 
that my flags are legitimate.

answer:
1.ssh -p 52925 ctf-player@rhea.picoctf.net
  password 6dd28e9b
  Checksum: 03b52eabed517324828b9e09cbbf8a7b0911f348f76cf989ba6d51acede6d5d8
2. ls
   checksum.txt  decrypt.sh  files
3. Check the file type of the checksum.txt
   cat checksum.txt
   03b52eabed517324828b9e09cbbf8a7b0911f348f76cf989ba6d51acede6d5d8
4. sha256sum files/*
   output of many lines of the format 03b52ede6d5d8......  files/00011a60
5.  compare these files with he checksum.txt:
     sha256sum files/* | grep "03b52eabed517324828b9e09cbbf8a7b0911f348f76cf989ba6d51acede6d5d8"
  
    output: files/00011a60
6.  check the file type:  
    file files/00011a60
    output: files/00011a60: openssl enc'd data with salted password	
7.  use the ./decrypt.sh to run this file salted hash 
    run ./decrypt.sh files/00011a60
    output: picoCTF{trust_but_verify_00011a60}
