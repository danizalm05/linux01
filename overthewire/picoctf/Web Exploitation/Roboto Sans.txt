Souluion:
     1. The challenge name suggests that we should investigate the robots.txt file.
 

    1. Get the robots.txt file on the web site with curl

    2. curl http://saturn.picoctf.net:57121/robots.txt  
       output:
				User-agent *
				Disallow: /cgi-bin/
				Think you have seen your flag or want to keep looking.

				ZmxhZzEudHh0;anMvbXlmaW
				anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==
				svssshjweuiwl;oiho.bsvdaslejg
				Disallow: /wp-admin/
	
	3.We have a number of encoded strings. Some of them seems to 
	   be base64 encoded.
	   
	   echo "anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==" | base64 -d
       output:
	         js/myfile.txt
    4. curl http://saturn.picoctf.net:57121/js/myfile.txt
	
	    output:
          picoCTF{Who_D03sN7_L1k5_90B0T5_718c9043}			 
	
	
	
	
	picoCTF{ }
