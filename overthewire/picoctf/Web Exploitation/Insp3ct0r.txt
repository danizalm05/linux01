Problem Statement:

Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection:
   https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/9670/  
 
 
Hints
   1. How do you inspect web code on a browser?
   2. There's 3 parts 

Solution
Here, we see a website with not much content. We are hinted by the problem 
statement to "inspect" the site. Using a browser's developing tools, we can
 see the source code of the site.  
 We then go to the Source tab and view the 
index.html, mycss.css, and myjs.js files, each containing a part of the flag. 

  line in index.html file
 <!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->

 line in css file (mycss.css)
/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */
 
 line in js file  (myjs.js)
 /* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?2e7b23e3} */

just add the 3 parts
 picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?2e7b23e3}
Flag

 picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?2e7b23e3}
