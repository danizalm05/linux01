Hints:
     folders folders folders
Souluion:
 
	1. Let's start by browsing to the web site and check the HTML source code.
       Press CTRL + U or right-click anywhere on the background and select View page source
	
	2. 
	The hint suggests we should check for folders and there are two files with several 
	possible subfolders:
       1:   <link href="vendor/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
       2:   src="secret/assets/DX1KYM.jpg"

 
	3. The most promising directory ought to be /secret/ so let's start with that.
	   http://saturn.picoctf.net:49602/secret/ 
    4.
	   we have a reference to a hidden/file.css file:
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="hidden/file.css" />

       Let's check the hidden directory.
       
	   curl saturn.picoctf.net:49602/secret/hidden/
    5.
	  We have two files referenced in a superhidden directory:
          1.<link href="superhidden/login.css" rel="stylesheet" />
          2. <input type="hidden" name="db" value="superhidden/xdfgwd.html" />
    6.
       Let's check that directory as well.
	   curl http://saturn.picoctf.net:49602/secret/hidden/superhidden/
