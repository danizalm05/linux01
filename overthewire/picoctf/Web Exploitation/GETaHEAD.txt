Problem :
  Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition

  http://mercury.picoctf.net:28916/

 Hints :
   1. Maybe you have more than 2 choices
   2. Check out tools like Burpsuite to modify your requests and look at
   the responses  

Solution:

 We need  making a HEAD request, since as soon as the page was visited, 
 a POST request was made. so perform it using curl with -I flag. Ths will
 return the HEAD
 
 run curl -I "http://mercury.picoctf.net:28916/"
  output :
     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     flag: picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_70bc61c4}
     Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
	
	
picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_6ef27873}
