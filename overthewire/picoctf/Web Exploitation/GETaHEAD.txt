Problem :
  Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition

  http://mercury.picoctf.net:28916/

 Hints :
   1. Maybe you have more than 2 choices
   2. Check out tools like Burpsuite to modify your requests and look at
   the responses  

Solution:

 We need  making a HEAD request, since as soon as the page was visited, 
 a POST request was made. so perform it using curl with -I flag. Ths will
 return the HEAD
 
 run curl -I "http://mercury.picoctf.net:28916/"
  output :
     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     flag: picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_70bc61c4}
     Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
	
	
picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_6ef27873}

 
 
 HTTP request methods
 -----------------------
 HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the purpose of the request
 and what is expected if the request is successful. 
 
 HTTP request methods are essential components of HTTP requests, allowing 
 clients to specify the desired action to be performed on a resource. 
 Some common HTTP request methods include GET, POST, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, 
 CONNECT, and OPTIONS. GET and POST are widely supported,
 while support for other methods may be limited but expanding. 
 
  GET requests are used to retrieve data, while POST requests are used to submit data to the server, often causing a change in state or side effects. HEAD requests ask for a response
  identical to a GET request but without the response body. 
 
GET:  only retrieve data and should not contain  a request content.
HEAD:  identical to a GET request, but without a response body.
POST: submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in 
    state or side effects on the server.
PUT: replaces all current representations of the target resource with the 
    request content.
