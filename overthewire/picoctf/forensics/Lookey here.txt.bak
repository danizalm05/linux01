Description

 Attackers have hidden information in a very large mass of data in the past, 
 maybe they are still doing it.
 Download the data :
       https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/124/anthem.flag.txt

Solutions:
 1. grep -i 'picoctf{'  anthem.flag.txt 
  output:    we think that the men of picoCTF{gr3p_15_@w3s0m3_4c479940}

 2. The most efficient way to get the flag is to use grep with -o to only
 output the matched text and -E to say that your pattern is an extended 
 regular expression
  grep -oE 'picoCTF{.*}' anthem.flag.txt
 

output:
  
  picoCTF{gr3p_15_@w3s0m3_4c479940}
