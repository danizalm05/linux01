Description:
 
Download the disk image: https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/164/disk.img.gz

 and use mmls on it to find the size of the Linux
 partition. Connect to the remote checker service to check your answer and
 get the flag.
 
 Access checker program: nc saturn.picoctf.net 50883
 Note: if you are using the webshell, 
download and extract the disk image into /tmp not your home directory.


Solution:
1. cd /tmp
   wget  https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/164/disk.img.gz

2.  gunzip disk.img 
     
3. file disk.img 
   disk.img: DOS/MBR boot sector; partition 1 : ID=0x83, active, 
   start-CHS (0x0,32,33), 
   end-CHS (0xc,190,50), startsector 2048, 202752 sectors

4. mmls disk.img
Offset Sector: 0
Units are in 512-byte sectors

      Slot      Start        End          Length       Description
000:  Meta      0000000000   0000000000   0000000001   Primary Table (#0)
001:  -------   0000000000   0000002047   0000002048   Unallocated
002:  000:000   0000002048   0000204799   0000202752   Linux (0x83)
 
5. nc saturn.picoctf.net 50428
  What is the size of the Linux partition in the given disk image?
  Length in sectors:

  you sould print the answer 20275
  the output is the fleg

The Sleuth Kit is a open-source library and collection of utilities for 
Unix-like operating systems and Windows that is used for extracting and 
parsing data from disk drives and other computer data storage devices so as
 to facilitate the forensic analysis of computer systems. 
 It forms the foundation for Autopsy, a better known tool that is
 essentially a graphical user interface to the command line 
utilities bundled with The Sleuth Kit.
