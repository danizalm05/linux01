Description
 
 We found a leak of a blackmarket website's login credentials. Can you find 
 the password of the user "cultiris" and successfully decrypt it? Download the leak here:
    https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/151/leak.tar

 The first user in usernames.txt corresponds to the first password in passwords.txt. The second user corresponds to the second password, and so on.


Hints: 
   Maybe other passwords will have hints about the leak?
   
Solutions:
   1.tar -xvf leak.tar: This will create a new directory 'leak'  with
   two files
       passwords.txt
       usernames.txt
 
   2.The first user in usernames.txt corresponds to the first password in passwords.txt. The second user corresponds to the second password, and so on.

     Searched for the user cultiris locating at line 378 and obtained its
	 corresponding password as cvpbPGS{P7e1S_54I35_71Z3}.

    grep -n cultiris  usernames.txt 
    output: 378:cultiris
           
    sed -n 378p  passwords.txt   (another way:cat -n passwords.txt| grep 378)
    output: cvpbPGS{P7e1S_54I35_71Z3}
    
	 The start of flag "picoCTF{" is corespond to "cvpbPGS{" so it is
	 clearly understood that the output  is encrypted.
	 The difference in the correspondint letters ascii value is 13.
	 Now decrypt by adding shifting the ascii value by 13 forward 
	 
	 echo  cvpbPGS{P7e1S_54I35_71Z3} | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'

Flag:
   picoCTF{C7r1F_54V35_71M3}
