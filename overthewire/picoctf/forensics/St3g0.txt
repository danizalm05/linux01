Solution:
  
	zsteg:  Detect stegano-hidden data in PNG & BMP
	https://github.com/zed-0xff/zsteg
	RubyGems is a package manager for Ruby.
    install  zsteg:  gem install zsteg
	uninstall zsteg:  gem uninstall zsteg
	
	
	1. wget  https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/216/pico.flag.png  
	
	2. zsteg -a pico.flag.png # --all                        try all known method
	3. The flag will  paer at begining of the output
	
	picoCTF{7h3r3_15_n0_5p00n_a1062667}
	
	
	
	
	
	
	2.  binwalk pico.flag.png 

			DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
			--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			0             0x0             PNG image, 585 x 172, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced
			41            0x29            Zlib compressed data, default compression
			
   As you can see above, the file contains two compartments the png image data and also a zip file. 
	 Often in these instances, an extraction of the zip file will give you the flag,
	 however in other cases, it's a pandora's box with encapsulation within encapsulation
	 (files within files) and you'll have to follow the method a few times to 
	 extract the final.

 3. extract the hidden files, run the command with the flag '-e' to extract the unknown files:

  This will automatically unzip the foreign file into your current directory.
  At this point, 'cat' the file to print the contents, 
  examine the type of file that's been extracted using 'file' and 'strings' and 
  repeat the process again.
