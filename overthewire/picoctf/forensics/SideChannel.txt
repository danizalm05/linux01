Description

  here's something fishy about this PIN-code checker, can you figure out the PIN and get the flag? Download the PIN checker program here pin_checker

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Hints
1. Read about "timing-based side-channel attacks."
2. Attempting to reverse-engineer or exploit the binary won't help you, you can figure out the PIN just by interacting with it and measuring certain properties about it.
3. Don't run your attacks against the master server, it is secured against them. The PIN code you get from the pin_checker binary is the same as the one for the master server
