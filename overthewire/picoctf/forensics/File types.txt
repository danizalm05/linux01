Description
This file was found among some files marked confidential but my pdf reader cannot read it, maybe yours can. You can download the file from here:
     https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/82/Flag.pdf

Hints:  
  
  Remember that some file types can contain and nest other files


Solutions:
  1. wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/82/Flag.pdf
  2. file Flag.pdf 
     Flag.pdf: shell archive text
  3. After doing 'cat Flag.pdf' you can see that this looks like a script  at the top of it says:
        run the file with sh.
  4. When doing 'sh Flag.pdf' we get this message:	
     
      x - created lock directory _sh00046.
      x - extracting flag (text)
      x - removed lock directory _sh00046.  
	  
	and a a file  named 'flag'  i s created.  
	(in case of an error run: sudo apt install sharutils)
 5. 'file flag'
    output: flag: current ar archive 
	
 6	By look in man ar you can see that "x" is how you extract. (man ar):
	 

    	 ar - create, modify, and extract from archives
	   ....
	   ....
	    x   Extract members (named member) from the archive.  You can use the v modifier with this operation, to request that ar list each name as it extracts it.
       If you do not specify a member, all files in the archive are extracted.

 7. ar x flag
     a new file is created (overwrite the previous file named flag 
 8. file flag
    output: flag: cpio archive
	
 9. looking at the man page to see the correct syntax for extracting:
        cpio --file flag -i	
	  ouptput: Erro meassage flag no created: newer or same age version exists
    This is because it can't overide
 
 10.  mv flag flag.cpio
 11.  cpio --file flag.cpio -i	
 12.  file flag
     output :flag bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900
 13. bunzip2 flag
      output : Can't guess original name for flag using flag.out

 14. file flag.out
   output:
     flag.out: gzip compresse data, was "flag" .... 
 15. mv flag.out flag.gz
 16. gunzip flag.gz
 17. file flag
     output: lzip compressed data, version 1
 18: lzip  -d flag	 
 19: file flag.out
     output: flag.out  LZ$ compressed data
 20  If lz4 id missing run :sudo apt install lz4
     lz4 -d flag.out flag
 21  file flag
     output:flag LZMA compressed data. non-streamed size 233
