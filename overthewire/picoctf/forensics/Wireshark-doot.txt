Problem :
   Can you find the flag? shark1.pcapng.
     https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/81c7862241faf4a48bd64a858392c92b/shark1.pcapng


Solution:  
  1. wget  https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/ea41c400c[…]d362ab/shark1.pcapng 
  2.  restrict the displayed packages to HTTP-Packages only. I thought, that the flag couldn’t hide inside the TCP-Protocoll packages like the [ACK] / [PSH/ACK] or ARP ones and the HTTP-ones were the ones looking most promising.  
  
    apply  the Filter 'http'
   
   every package is encrypted. After scrolling a while, we finally get to a packet that isn’t. Package number 827 consists of text/html. Hey, thats a breadcrumb!
   Opening the package in a new window we get 1 line of text/html that looks really promising
   show package in a new window
   the text is :
      Gur synt vf cvpbPGS{c33xno00_1_f33_h_qrnqorrs}

    it could be encrypted with a simple ROT-Cipher.  
	 The ROT cipher, short for "rotation," is a simple encryption method that replaces each letter in a message with another letter located a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

       	The flag is picoCTF{p33kab00_1_s33_u_deadbeef}
    tcp.port==80
	
     
      
picoCTF{p33kab00_1_s33_u_deadbeef}
