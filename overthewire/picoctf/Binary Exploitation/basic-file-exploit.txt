Problem Statement:
The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you 
wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it!

Connect to the program with netcat: 
                          nc saturn.picoctf.net 54873
The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded 
from:

Hints:
  1. Try passing in things the program doesn't expect. 
     Like a string instead of a number.
