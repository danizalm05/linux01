Problem Statement:
The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you 
wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it!

Connect to the program with netcat: 
                          nc saturn.picoctf.net 54873
The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded 
from:
  https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/543/program-redacted.c

Hints:
  1. Try passing in things the program doesn't expect. 
     Like a string instead of a number.

Type '3' to exit the program

 If we look into the source code, we see that flag is defined as a constant.
 If we search for other use of the variable flag, we can only find it in 
 the data_read() function as follows.

if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
    puts(flag);
    fseek(stdin, 0, SEEK_END);
    exit(0);
}

Thus, if we can make the output of strtol to be 0, we will force the 
program to print the flag.
