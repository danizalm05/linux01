Problem :

I decided to try something noone else has before. I made a bot to 
automatically trade stonks for me using AI and machine learning. 
I wouldn't believe
 you if you told me it's unsecure! 
 vuln.c :
  https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/17ba7f9351aca192c45833c658742fe5/vuln.c 
 nc mercury.picoctf.net 27912

 Hints :
  Okay, maybe I'd believe you if you find my API key.
     
Solution:
 the solution   works by sending a string of repeating %p to the 
 format string function in the program. 
 The program replaces these %ps with values from the stack. 
 Eventually, we work our way up the stack far enough to get to the api_buf 
 and print that out in little endian hexadecimal. 
 
 1.run : nc mercury.picoctf.net 27912
 2. chose option   1) Buy some stonks!
 3. to theprompt What is your API token?
  input the string: "%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p"
 4.the output is a long hex string;
 5. open https://cyberchef.org
 6 . input the hex string
 7 serach from hex and drag it to 'recipe window'
 8. In order to flip it arount look for 'swap endianss'
 10.so start all over again
      drag the 'swap endianss' to the recipe window
	  drag 'From Hex' to the recipe window.
	  start erasing char from the input window until you will see
	  the flag in the ouput window.

Format string vulnerability = a bug where user input is passed as the
format argument  to printf, scanf, or another function in that family.
 
  “stonks” represents overconfidence, blind optimism, or joking positivity 
  about asset prices going up—regardless 
  of whether the fundamentals support it.
