Description

Here's a program that plays rock, paper, scissors against you. I hear something good happens if you win 5 times in a row. The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded here:
      https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/146/game-redacted.c
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Connect to the program with netcat: 
        $ nc saturn.picoctf.net 62901


Hints

How does the program check if you won?
 Notice the Below code

if (wins >= 5) {
        puts("Congrats, here's the flag!");
        puts(flag);
      }

If the value of wins ≥ 5 then it will display the Flag.

 In order to get the Flag, we have to continuously win 5 Times.
So Let’s Analyse the play() Function

if (strstr(player_turn, loses[computer_turn])) {
    puts("You win! Play again?");
    return true;
  } else {
    puts("Seems like you didn't win this time. Play again?");
    return false;
  }

Here the strstr()function is used to check whether the string loses[computer_turn] is in the string of player_turn .If present it will return true

Demonstration Example:

char* hands[3] = {"rock", "paper", "scissors"};
char* loses[3] = {"paper", "scissors", "rock"};

player_turn = rock
computer_turn = 2--> Means hand[2] -- scissors
loses[computer_turn] = rock
  
Souluion:
   So the get the Flag, we have to use the 'stringrockpaperscissors' as Input for 5 Times
