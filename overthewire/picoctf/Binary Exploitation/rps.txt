Description

Here's a program that plays rock, paper, scissors against you. I hear something good happens if you win 5 times in a row. The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded here:
      https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/146/game-redacted.c
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Connect to the program with netcat: 
        $ nc saturn.picoctf.net 62901


Hints

How does the program check if you won?
