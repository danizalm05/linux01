Problem Statement

    Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look 
	through manually, something tells me there is a better way. 
	You can also find the file in /problems/first-grep_2_04dbf496b78e6c37c0097cdfef734d88 on the shell server.

Hints

    grep tutorial

Solution

When we simply cat this file in the shell to find the flag, we are met with 
a lot of random noise. Here,we can use a grep command. 
What grep does is it filters for a specific expression in a plain-text. 
We know that picoCTF flags are all in the format of picoCTF{...}, so we can 
grep for the expression picoCTF. Specifically, 
we would do cat file | grep picoCTF.
