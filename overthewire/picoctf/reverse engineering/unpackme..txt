Description:
 
Our data got corrupted on the way here. 
Luckily, nothing got replaced, but every block of 3 got scrambled around! 

The first word seems to be three letters long, maybe you can use that to recover the rest of the message.

Download the corrupted message here:
   https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/191/message.txt

The meassage :
   heTfl g as iicpCTo{7F4NRP051N5_16_35P3X51N3_V6E5926A}4

Hints:
1. Split the message up into blocks of 3 and see how the first block is scrambled
  
 



Soultion: 
 It looks like in each block of three characters the first is shifted to the end of the block.

Let's write a small Python script called solve.py to decode this

#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: latin-1 -*-

encrypted_msg = "heTfl g as iicpCTo{7F4NRP051N5_16_35P3X51N3_V091B0AE}4"
                 
i = 0
flag = ""

while i < len(encrypted_msg):
    flag += encrypted_msg[i+2]
    flag += encrypted_msg[i]
    flag += encrypted_msg[i+1]
    i += 3

print(flag)

     
        
	The flag is picoCTF{7R4N5P051N6_15_3XP3N51V3_56E6924A}
