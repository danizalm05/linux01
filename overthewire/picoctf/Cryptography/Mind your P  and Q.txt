Problem :
 In RSA, a small e value can be problematic, but what about N? Can you decrypt this? 
  values:
   Decrypt my super sick RSA:
    c: 62324783949134119159408816513334912534343517300880137691662780895409992760262021

Hints :
   Bits are expensive, I used only a little bit over 100 to save money
   
Solution:
  
                  
   a ≡ b (mod n):  a and b have the same remainder when divided by m.
   or  equivalently, the difference a − b is a multiple of n, 
     
	 
	 
   modular multiplicative inverse     הופכי כפלי מודולרי
   a x ≡ 1 ( mod m ):  
    modular multiplicative inverse of an integer a is an integer x such that 
	the product ax is congruent to 1 with respect to the modulus m.
	 
 Example 
    in modulo 9, what is the  modular multiplicative inverse of 2.
    So we need the find X  in the next Euation: 
                           2 * X  ≡ 1 ( mod  9 )
	the answer  is 5, because
                           2 * 5  ≡ 1 ( mod  9 )
						   
	
    Relatively Prime and Coprime Numbers:
     are integers that share no common positive divisor other than 1. This means that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these numbers is 1.
    Euler's Totient Function:
     denoted as φ(n), counts the number of positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n					   
  
   RSA-based cryptography 
   ------------------------------------
   Public Key:  used for encryption and can be shared freely with others.
   Private Key:  used for decryption and remain secret. 
    It is mathematically linked to the public key but cannot be easily derived from it.
   
  
  
   
  To generate these keys:

  1. Choose two large prime numbers p and q
  2. Compute their product  n = p * q
  3. Calculate  φ(n) = (p−1)(q−1)      (φ(n) is Euler's totient function)
  4. Choose an encryption exponent e such that  1 < e < φ(n)  and  e is coprime with φ(n)
  5. Calculate the decryption exponent d such that  e * d ≡ 1(mod ϕ(n) )

  The public key is  (n,e)  and the private key is  (n,d)
 
  Encryption
  =========================
   Alice wants to send a secure message M to Bob:
    Alice will use Bob's public key  (n,e)
    The encryption formula is: C = (M ^ e ) mod  n
    where C is the ciphertext,   M is the plaintext message (converted to a number), and  n and  e
    are part of the public key.
 
   Decryption
 =========================
 Bob can decrypt the message using his private key  (n,d)
  The decryption formula is: M = (C ^ d ) mod n
  where  C is the ciphertext and  d is part of Bob's private key.
