Problem Statement:

 The numbers... what do they mean?

Hints:
 1. The flag is in the format PICOCTF{}
 
 
  

Solution
  When we  open this file and simply look at the image, we can see that 
  there are a sequence of numbers. We can quickly realise that these 
  numbers are   1 to 26. When we manually find the characters at each index 
  in the alphabet in uppercase, we get our flag. 
   
  We could also use a this  script :
  
  nums = [16, 9, 3, 15, 3, 20, 6, '{', 20, 8, 5, 14, 21, 13, 2, 5, 18, 19, 13, 1, 19, 15, 14, '}']
  for n in nums:
    if type(n) is int:
        print(chr(n+64), end='')
    else:
        print(n, end='')
