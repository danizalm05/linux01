A type of transposition cipher is the rail fence cipher, which is described here:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_fence_cipher  
 Here is one such cipher encrypted using the rail fence with 4 rails. Can you decrypt it?
 Download the message here. 
 Put the decoded message in the picoCTF flag format, picoCTF{decoded_message}.

Hints: 
Once you've understood how the cipher works, it's best to draw it out yourself on paper
 

Solutions:
   
 you can use this online service at Planet Calc.

It "brute-forces" the number of rails up to a maximum number (with a default of 10).
Enter the given encoded text in the Encoded message text box and press 'CALCULATE'.
And you will get the flag in the output with 4 rails in the Decode table.


output:
  The flag is: WH3R3_D035_7H3_F3NC3_8361N_4ND_3ND_83F6D8D7
   picoCTF{WH3R3_D035_7H3_F3NC3_8361N_4ND_3ND_83F6D8D7}
