Problem Statement:
 We found this weird message being passed around on the servers, we think 
 we have a working decryption scheme. 
 Download the message here: https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/127/message.txt
 Take each number mod 37 and map it to the following character set: 0-25 is 
 the alphabet (uppercase), 26-35 are the decimal digits, and 36 is an 
 underscore. Wrap your decrypted 
 message in the picoCTF flag format (i.e. picoCTF{decrypted_message})
