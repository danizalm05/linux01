nmap -sV 10.10.34.169

Identified open ports:

	you can open the web page in url =  'http://10.10.34.169:3333/'
	
Task 3:    Locating directories using Gobuster
------------------------------
Gobuster is a tool for brute-forcing URIs (directories and files), DNS subdomains, and virtual host names.  

 gobuster dir -u http://IP:3333 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-1.0.txt

What is the directory that has an upload form page?
Try to open all the paths . you will find the uploa page in the next path:
http://IP:3333/internal/


Task 4: Compromise the Webserver
-------------------------------------------
Now that you have found a form to upload files, (http://IP:3333/internal/)we can leverage this to upload and execute our payload, which will lead to compromising the web server.

    Answer the questions below:

    What common file type you'd want to upload to exploit the server is blocked? 

    Logically, the ideal would be to upload a .php file to execute code. Imagine it as a Trojan horse.


    We will fuzz the upload form to identify which extensions are not blocked. To do this, we'll use BurpSuite. Weâ€™re going to use Intruder (used to automate custom attacks). To start, make a wordlist with the following extensions:

nano phplist.txt
input the next list:
.php
.php3
.php4
.php5
.phtml

Ctrl + x and then y to save the file.
cat phplist.txt

Search "foxyproxy extension" and add it 

We go into the FoxyProxy options and add a new proxy and click Save.
