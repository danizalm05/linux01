-----------------   dir -----------------
 web page    http://$IP 

 in the source code http://$IP  there is a comant:
     'Note to self, remember username! Username:    R1ckRul3s

 in   http://$IP/robots.txt
  there is a line:                             Wubbalubbadubdub
 http://$IP/assets/	
    list of files
 http://$IP/login.php
    login page 
 http://$IP/clue.txt  	
          'Look around the file system for the other ingredient.'	
	
---------	

move to  http://$IP/login.php       user = R1ckRul3s passward = Wubbalubbadubdub

in the command line window run ' grep -r . '
 The result is: 
   	recursively scan for everything so all conntend of the directory is displayed
1. What is the first ingredient that Rick needs?
  in command window run :ls
  open file   Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt 
            in url: http://10.10.238.112/Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt 
			
   you can use nl 	Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt	
    to get same results.   
 the connted is :         'mr. meeseek hair'

2. What is the second ingredient in Rick’s potion?
  in clue.txt you will  find:
          'Look around the file system for the other ingredient.'	
     
   So   Lets look at the home folder
   in command line run ls /home
   result: rick
   run: ls /home/rick
   result : second ingredients
   run:   nl   '/home/rick/second ingredients'
   
   open  http://$IP/login.php
    




    What is the last and final ingredient?

Another interesting folder to look at when we were enumerationg the system is the root folder. We don't have permissions to view the folder, so we must elevate our privileges somehow.

Using sudo -l we can check what commands we are allowed to execute with sudo privileges.

Looks like we can execute everything with sudo. So lets look in the root folder using: sudo ls /root.

This works! And we can find a 3rd ingredient file in this folder.
 
run  sudo   nl  /root/3rd.txt
 3rd ingredients: fleeb juice
-----------------------------------------------------------


Another war using python.

try to run in the command line the commaand 
 python3 -c "print('Hello')"
 if the result is "hello"   then you can run python in the system
