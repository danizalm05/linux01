[Day 1] Inventory Management
 

 a.What is the name of the cookie used for authentication?
   1. Access the website at http://<your_machines_ip>:3000
   2. On the login Register as user  on the website.
   3. Login and open the developer tools to look at the cookie stored in our browser. navigated to the Storage tab (in Firefox) or Application tab (in Chrome/Edge).
   Within this tab, selecte  the Cookies menu on the left-hand side. 
     authid 
 b.  
    authid:"Y2N2NGVyOWxsMSFzcw%3D%3D"
    If you decode the cookie, what is the value of the fixed part of the cookie?

     When you consider that “%3D” translates to “=” we can tell that this cookie is encoded with Base64.
	 Search up “base64 decode online” 
     You can use 'Cyber Chef'. https://www.cyberchef.dev/cyberchef 
	 on the right side window input the cookie
	 from the left tab drag  option "From base64" yow will get output
	 <user name>v4er9ll1!ss7
	 so the fix part is "v4er9ll1!ss7"   
	 
	 
 c. After accessing his account, what did the user mcinventory    request?     
     This question is about the specfic user: "mcinventory"
     Add   user  "mcinventory" in front of the fixed part of the cookie 
	      mcinventoryv4er9ll1!ss
		   
	 and encoding it through Cyber Chef using "Tobase64" we get the following cookie:
	    bWNpbnZlbnRvcnl2NGVyOWxsMSFzcw== 
	 you can also use the command:
	           echo -ne 'mcinventoryv4er9ll1!ss' | base64
	 Change the value of our existing cookie to the value we just created and reload the page. 
	 As far as the server is concerned, because you gave it Mcinventory’s key when it asked, you must be Mcinventory — so it let you in without credentials.
	 
	 Looks like we are now logged in as mcinventory. On the home page we can see what het requested.	
	 
	  In the entries table, mcinventory requested:
	                       firewall.
 
 
     cookies that have fixed values are bad as it allows attackers to guess the pattern and values.

    a new cookie can be created from Firefox
