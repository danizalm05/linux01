 In this task we are looking at a network capture to identify any information we need.
  
a.  What data was exfiltrated via DNS?

  1. download ( holidaythief.pcap ) and open  it up in Wireshark.
  It   has hinted that the data was exfiltrated via DNS .
  Start by filtering for packets operating with the DNS  .
  Straight away we can see that the third packet (and   more) is querying a hex string subdomain of the holidaythief.com domain.
   try converting the hex string into ASCII text.
   43616e64792043616e652053657269616c204e756d6265722038343931
   using https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-ascii.html
   the result is :
             Candy Cane Serial Number 8491
   
   You can also use: 
   echo  43616e64792043616e652053657269616c204e756d6265722038343931 | xxd -r -p
