This challenge is an OSINT (Open-source intelligence) challenge. 
We’re given an image of the Grinch and told to perform an OSINT attack on 
“Elf Lola”. As per usual, TryHackMe have provided supporting material — 
 this time in the form of a blog post.
 
In the challenge, there will be three main OSINT techniques:
1. Image Metadata - Image metadata is text information that is pertaining to an image file.
        
2. WayBack Machine -  a digital archive of the World Wide Web. It takes a snapshot of a website. 
For example, here is what Google looked like on 8th Feb 1999: https://web.archive.org/web/19990208004515/http://google.com/

3. Reverse Image Search - search the internet with an image
	
a. What is Lola's date of birth? Format: Month Date, Year(e.g November 12, 2019)
   hint: What information can you get from exiftool? Are they using the 
   same Creator name on any social networks... Twitter Perhaps?
  
  Answer : download the task file,it's an image and use exiftools.
   in the this case i am using an oמline https://exifmeta.com/
   upload the image on Creator you will see: 	  "JLolax1" 
  Lets look  that name anywhere else?  in Social media is the obvious place to start
  Google Dorks reveal precious little, so we’re stuck searching the internet the old
  fashioned way. Facebook is a dead-end, but the next site on the list — Twitter — scores
