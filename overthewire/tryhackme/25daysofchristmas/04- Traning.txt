	output:
	   ./file6:passwordHpKRQfdxzZocwg5O0RsiyLSVQon72CjFmsV4ZLGjxI8tXYo1NhLsEply
   answer: file6
d. What is the IP address in a file in the home folder?
	  Using regex we need to find a pattern rather than a string.
	  
	  
cat * | grep -Eo "([0-9]{1,3}[\.]){3}[0-9]{1,3}" : Find ip pattern in all the files in the dir 
 
 ([0-9]{1,3}[\.]):  look for between one and three numbers (0–9), followed by a period
 {3} says that we’re looking for three repetitions of the prior instruction
 [0-9]{1,3} looks for one more set of one to three numbers between 0 and 9 ,without the trailing period
 
 cat * :gets the contents of every file in the directory  
 
  -E : using an extended regex,  
  -o : output the bit that it matched, not the entire line.
  
  output
