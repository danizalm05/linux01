problem: Password stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
and can only be read by user bandit14.
For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get
a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level.
Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

So we need to use ssh to login to another users account:
bandit14@localhost for us.

solution:
1. ls
output: A file sshkey.private. This is a private ssh key
2. cat sshkey.private
3. ssh -i ./sshkey.private bandit14@localhost
4. print yes to question are you sure
5. Now we are login as bandit14
6. cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
