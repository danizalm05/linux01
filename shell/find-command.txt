 
find: Search for files that meet a desired criteria
  
find -name "filename": Find file by its file name

find ./ -size 1033c ! -executable: find a file somewhere under the inhere directory and has following  properties:  
     human-readable   • 1033 bytes in size  • not executable

find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c :   find a file  somewhere on the
        server and has all of the following properties:
          owned by user bandit7   owned by group bandit6  33 bytes in size

find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c  2>/dev/null
    The same as the above but all  errors will be send to error output (2>/dev/null) so they will not showen 
    on the out put display



 find / -user bandit20:   find all  file  owned  by user = bandit20
 

 
 find $HOME -mtime 0
    Search  for files in your home directory which have been modified in the last twenty-four hours. 
   This command
       works this way because the time since each file was last modified is divided by 24 hours and any remainder  is
       discarded.   That  means  that to match -mtime 0, a file will have to have a modification in the past which is
       less than 24 hours ago.

 find /sbin /usr/sbin -executable \! -readable -print

       Search for files which are executable but not readable.

 find . -perm 664

       Search for files which have read and write permission for their owner, and group, but which  other  users  can
       read  but  not  write to.  Files which meet these criteria but have other permissions bits set (for example if
       someone can execute the file) will not be matched.


find . -perm -220
       find . -perm -g+w,u+w

       Both  these  commands  do  the  same  thing; search for files which are writable by both their owner and their
       group.
